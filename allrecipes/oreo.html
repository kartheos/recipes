    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Make your own version of the classic cookie with this recipe. The chocolate cookie is sandwiched with a creamy filling for a delicious treat.</p>
  
    <h2>Serving: 40</h2>
    <p>(28.8g per Oreo - number of servings equivalent to one tray bake.)</p>

    <h2>Cooking time: 45 minutes</h2>

    <h2>You'll Need the following Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup unsalted butter(225 g),</li>
        <li>1 cup white sugar(200 g)</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour(250 g)</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups dark cocoa powder(150 g)</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
        
    </ul>

    <h2>Oreo Recipe in Easy Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, cream together 1 cup (225 grams) of softened butter with the white sugar and salt, until light and fluffy</li>
        <li>Beat in eggs until fully incorporated</li>
        <li>Sieve together the flour, cocoa powder, and baking soda into the mix. Blend well</li>
        <li>Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, and mix together until combined</li>
        <li>Turn the dough out onto your surface and push together into a flat square. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 325˚F (160˚C)</li>
        <li>Remove the dough from the fridge, and for ease of rolling out, divide the dough into 4 (this way the dough stays cool longer and prevents the need of re-chilling later on)</li>
        <li>To roll out the dough, place a quarter of the dough between two sheets of parchment paper (alternatively the dough can be rolled out on a lightly floured surface - though the parchment is preferred as it prevents any additional flour from altering the color/appearance of the dark cookies). Roll the dough between the two sheets of parchment to ¼-inch (½ cm) thickness</li>
        <li>Using a small round cookie cutter (alternatively, we found the rim of a champagne glass to be a perfect size!) cut the dough into individual rounds and place on a large parchment-lined baking sheet, leaving at least ½-inch (1¼ cm) between each cookie</li>
        <li>Pack together and re-roll out any scraps to cut additional cookies. Repeat with this process with each remaining ¼ of the dough</li>
        <li>Bake in a preheated oven for 15 minutes. If baking multiple trays at the same time, be sure to rotate the pans in the oven halfway through. Remove and transfer cookies to a cooling rack to cool completely</li>
        <li>To make the filling, combine ½ cup (115 grams) butter, powdered sugar, and vanilla in a medium mixing bowl. Beat together until light and fluffy</li>
        <li>Assemble the cookies by spreading a generous scoop of the icing onto one of the cookies and sandwiching it with another. Give it a light squeeze and scrape any excess off to clear and even out the sides</li>
        <li>Serve with a glass of milk</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Serving: 48</h2>
    <p>(28.8g per Cookie - number of servings equivalent to one tray bake.)</p>

    <h2>Cooking time: 30 minutes</h2>

    <h2>You'll Need the following Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup Butter: This classic chocolate chip cookie recipe starts with two sticks of butter creamed with white and brown sugars. The blend of sugars creates a perfectly balanced flavor.</li>
        <li>2 Eggs: Eggs add moisture and act as a binding agent, which means they help hold the dough together</li>
        <li>1 cup Vanilla: Vanilla extract enhances the overall flavor of the chocolate chip cookies</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Baking soda: Baking soda acts as a leavener, which means it helps the cookies rise</li>
        <li>1 cup Water: A bit of hot water creates steam as it bakes, working with the baking soda to puff the cookies up</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Salt: A pinch of salt enhances the flavors of the other ingredients, but it won't make the cookies taste salty</li>
        <li>1 cup Flour: All-purpose flour helps create gluten, which adds structure to the cookie dough</li>
        <li>1 cup Chocolate chips: Of course, you'll need semisweet chocolate chips! You can use dark or milk chocolate chips if you prefer</li>
        <li>1 cup Nuts (optional): Walnuts are optional, but they add nutty flavor and a welcome crunch</li>
        
    </ul>
